    strong technical depth in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python ecosystems, alongside additional, technical breadth in
    the technologies of Java, PHP, R, C, C#, and C++. As a Software Developer, I aim to contribute to the progress of

    `I first explored programming as part of my hobby making simple tools and mods for video games, with Python in
    2014 and JavaScript with Node.js in 2017. I initially studied biology to pursue a career in academic or medical
    research, but after finding my hyper-empathy and hand tremors hampering lab work, I changed my focus toward
    data science and web development.`,

    `To suppliment my skills beyond hobbies and university coursework, following my graduation I enrolled in Lambda
    School's online training academy, specializing in full stack web development and computer science. Lambda School
    featured a fast-paced curriculum and a job-accurate working environment. While enrolled, I developed, tested,
    documented, and deployed responsive and REST-ful web aplications, collaborating on remote, cross-functional
    teams with agile methodology.`,
