    `I first explored programming as part of my hobby making tools for video games, learning Python in 2014
    and JavaScript with Node.js in 2017. I initially studied biology to pursue a career in academic or medical
    research, but after finding my hyper-empathy and hand tremors hampering lab work, I changed my focus toward
    data science and software development.`,

    `Following my university graduation, I studied computer science and web development at Lambda School's online training academy.
    While enrolled, I developed, tested, documented, and deployed responsive and REST-ful web aplications, collaborating on remote,
    cross-functional teams with agile methodology.`,

    `After completing my training, I began working as a Software Developer for Academic Analytics LLC. I used my skills to 
    remotely collaborate with an international team of developers, analylists, and managers; bugfix, enhance, and redeploy legacy software;
    automate common tasks; and maintain and improve internal web applications and database services.`
