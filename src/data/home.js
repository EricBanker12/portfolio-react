    `I am Eric Banker, a Full Stack Web Developer, with a passion for healthcare and technology. I have strong
    technical depth with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js technologies, and cloud deployment, alongside
    additional, technical breadth in the technologies of Python, Java, PHP, R, C, and C++.`,

    `I first learned JavaScript and Node.js in 2017 as a hobby making tools and mods for video games. I was studying
    Genetics and Cellular Biology to pursue a career in research, but after losing my brother to Neuroblastoma, I
    realized I was too empathetic and my hands too shaky to make a living from lab work. As I had some background in
    data science and enjoyed programming, I shifted my goals toward a career in technology.`,

    `Following my graduation from university, in 2019 I enrolled in Lambda School's online training academy,
    specializing in full stack web development and computer science. Lambda School featured a faster-paced curriculum,
    a more realistic representation of the outside work-environment, and a more forgiving tuition arrangement, compared
    to completing another degree at my university. Over the last year, I built web applications with responsive front
    ends, REST-ful back ends, thorough documentation, and automated testing. I collaborated on remote, cross-functional
    teams and experienced agile development in pseudo production environments.`,

    `I am Eric Banker, a Full Stack Web Developer. My dream is to bring meaningful progress to the field of healthcare
    and the enjoyment of technology. Let's do it!`,
