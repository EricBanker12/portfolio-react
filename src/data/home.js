    technical depth in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, alongside additional, technical breadth in the

    `I first explored programming as part of my hobby making simple tools and mods for video games, with Python in
    2014 and JavaScript with Node.js in 2017. I initially studied Biology to pursue a career in academic or medical
    research, but after finding my hyper-empathy and hand tremors hampering any precision lab work, I changed my focus
    toward data science and web development.`,

    `Following my graduation from university, I enrolled in Lambda School's online training academy,
    specializing in full stack web development and computer science. Lambda School featured a faster-paced curriculum
    and a more realistic representation of the outside work-environment. I developed, tested, documented, and
    deployed responsive and REST-ful web aplications, collaborating on remote, cross-functional teams with agile
    methodology.`,

    `I am Eric Banker, a Full Stack Software Developer. My dream is to bring meaningful progress to fields of academic research,
    healthcare, and the enjoyment of technology. Let's do it!`,
