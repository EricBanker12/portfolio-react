I have\n    strong technical depth in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Python ecosystems, alongside additional, technical breadth in\n    the technologies of Java, PHP, R, C, and C++. As a Software Developer, I aim to contribute to the progress of\n    modern healthcare and the enjoyment of technology.","I first explored programming as part of my hobby making tools for video games, learning Python in 2014\n    and JavaScript with Node.js in 2017. I initially studied biology to pursue a career in academic or medical\n    research, but after finding my hyper-empathy and hand tremors hampering lab work, I changed my focus toward\n    data science and software development.","Following my university graduation, I studied computer science and web development at Lambda School's online training academy.\n    While enrolled, I developed, tested, documented, and deployed responsive and REST-ful web aplications, collaborating on remote,\n    cross-functional teams with agile methodology.","After completing my training, I began working as a Software Developer for Academic Analytics LLC. I used my skills to \n    remotely collaborate with an international team of developers, analylists, and managers; bugfix, enhance, and redeploy legacy software;\n    automate common tasks; and maintain and improve internal web applications and database services."];a.default=function(){var e=Object(i.useStaticQuery)("2740815994"),a=e.me.childImageSharp.fluid,n=e.site.siteMetadata.siteUrl+a.src;return o.a.createElement(s.a,null,o.a.createElement(c.a,{title:"Home",meta:[{property:"og:image",content:n},{name:"twitter:image",content:n}]}),o.a.createElement(d.a,{title:"Home",next:"Skills"}),m.map((function(e,a){return o.a.createElement("p",{key:a},e)})),o.a.createElement(l.a,{style:{marginTop:"1rem"},fluid:a,alt:"Eric Banker"}))}}}]);
